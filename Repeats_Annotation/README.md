# Telomere and Centromere annotation


















### Requirments
To run quarTeT the packages from [Requirments](https://github.com/mbxss28/LIFE4136_rotation3_Group3/blob/main/Repeats_Annotation/requirements.txt) need to be install in a env using this command conda create -n example --channel conda-forge --channel bioconda python=3.11.4. After installing this command :

git clone https://github.com/aaranyue/quarTeT 

into the working directory being used rather than installing it into the conda env that was created. The instructions for this pipeline come from the [quarTeT](https://github.com/aaranyue/quarTeT) page.
