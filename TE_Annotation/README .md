# Transposable element annotation

## EDTA
Before running a curated library was created to help with the EDTA search and maintaing of TE familes such as SINEs.

EDTA used the 087_203_mapq_hap1_8.fa and 087_203_mapq_hap2_8.fa files and accompning fasta files containing information of the CDS sequences for the search with output files being gff files of the TE annotations for the seperate genomes as well as pdfs of TE density and divergence of TEs.
